For those of you who were not able to make it to last week's meeting, I announced that there will be officer nominations this coming week. I had a great time serving as president this semester, and I would definitely encourage anyone to run for an officer position. Below you can find a brief description of the officer positions:

- President - runs meetings, plans for meetings, organizes other officers, plans events, maintains communication with advisors

- Vice president - runs meetings, plans for meetings and events

- Secretary - takes meeting minutes, maintains membership status, oversees Facebook group, maintains communication with all club members

- Treasurer - handles any funds

- Webmaster - maintains the club website

Nominations will take place at this week's meeting (March 29th). You are allowed to nominate yourself, but all nominations must be seconded. At the next week's meeting (April 5th), we will have all the nominees for each position give a short speech, and we will vote immediately after the speeches for a particular position. You can run for more than one position, and in fact, this is encouraged as you will be more likely to get a position.
